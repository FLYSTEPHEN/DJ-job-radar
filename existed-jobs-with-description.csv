8,Senior Investigative Reporter,The Markup,"New York, New York",2 Days Ago,https://careers.journalists.org/jobs/11677622/senior-investigative-reporter,NaN,careers,"
 Welcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring! Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019. The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects. The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status. About the position At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.  Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.  Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.  This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.  Responsibilities Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.  Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup’s Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.  You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.  

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won’t be many people who have done it before. So don’t worry if you haven’t done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are: You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.  You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist. You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change. You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline. You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious. You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.  You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed. You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we’ll all be learning how to do it together. Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.  


NOTES:

				Employer will assist with relocation costs.Additional Salary Information: We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $150,000, and will be established based on the successful candidate's experience, education and skills.
