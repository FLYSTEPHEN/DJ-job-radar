8,Senior Investigative Reporter,The Markup,"New York, New York",2 Days Ago,https://careers.journalists.org/jobs/11677622/senior-investigative-reporter,NaN,careers,"
 Welcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring! Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019. The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects. The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status. About the position At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.  Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.  Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.  This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.  Responsibilities Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.  Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup’s Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.  You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.  

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won’t be many people who have done it before. So don’t worry if you haven’t done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are: You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.  You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist. You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change. You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline. You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious. You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.  You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed. You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we’ll all be learning how to do it together. Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.  


NOTES:

				Employer will assist with relocation costs.Additional Salary Information: We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

201,K Club Coordinator,Knox College,"Galesburg, Illinois",1 Week Ago,https://careers.journalists.org/jobs/11661456/k-club-coordinator,NaN,careers,"
 Knox College invites applications for the new position of K Club Coordinator reporting to the Vice President for Advancement. The K Club is the athletic booster organization for Knox College athletics. The full-time, 12-month position will be responsible for marketing, alumni and parent engagement, and fundraising for the College’s 20 Prairie Fire intercollegiate athletic teams among alumni, parents, and other College constituents. The role works collaboratively with colleagues in Advancement (both fundraising and alumni relations), the Office of Athletics, and the Office of Communications.  

Knox College, a member of the Midwest Conference and NCAA Division III, is a vibrant community of scholar-teachers and students with a tradition of free inquiry, independent thought, and diverse perspectives. Competition in the Midwest Conference is intense and spirited, including the local rivalry between Knox and Monmouth College—the sixth-oldest athletic rivalry in the country. That’s only part of the story, however. Knox College is also one of the 50 most diverse campuses in America. Founded by abolitionists in 1837, the College was among the first in the nation to admit women and students of color and has a historic commitment to keeping a high-quality education accessible to all students, regardless of financial means. The New York Times ranked Knox #16 on its 2017 College Access Index in recognition of its commitment to low- and middle-income students and its role as an engine of upward mobility. Forbes has included Knox in its annual Grateful Grads rankings for the last six years running. And, recently, U.S. News & World Report listed Knox among the top 50 U.S. colleges for “best undergraduate teaching.” Knox athletes are student-athletes with a focus on achievement in the classroom, on the court or playing field and as community leaders. Institutional support for enhancing intercollegiate athletics is strong and recent successes include multiple conference championships in men’s and women’s soccer, and an NCAA championship appearance for women's soccer and a record-setting year for the women’s basketball program in 2017. The K Club booster organization has been active for eight years with a significant upward trajectory both in engagement and dollars raised. This past year, the booster club surpassed $500,000 in gifts and more than 1,000 donors. The club made possible a state-of-the-art golf performance center and converted the College’s grass soccer field to the highest-grade synthetic turf. The successful candidate will continue these successes and grow engagement among a wider audience. Responsibilities The role includes event planning and management; writing newsletters and engaging communications for a variety of social media platforms; and annual and team-based fundraising. The position will also serve as the staff coordinator of a new K Club Engagement Council. The role requires availability for travel up to 20% of the time with occasional overnight travel. Alumni & Parent Engagement Working with the K Club Council, the Coordinator will manage engagement activities of the Council with their respective intercollegiate teams and with current parents, including messaging for Council members to share with alumni and parents, social media postings, and invitations to athletic reunions and game tailgates. The Coordinator will coordinate with the athletic director and respective coaches K Club events both on and off campus including: team/sport reunions, tailgates, special gatherings, golf outings, and homecomings. He/she will also market select games regionally and those tied to conference or NCAA tournament. Working with Alumni Relations and the K Club Engagement Council, the Coordinator will encourage letter winners and current parents to engage one-on-one either on campus or virtually through the College’s Professional-in-Residence program. Marketing The Coordinator will provide updates, graphics, talking points and social media posts to the Council, coaches, SID, and athletes to use in their social media accounts. The Coordinator is the editor of the K Club monthly e-newsletter, The FireWire, and will author content for both the newsletter as well as on the Prairie Fire web site and alumni magazine. Fundraising The Coordinator will oversee all annual fundraising for the club, including the annual appeal and specific sports appeals. The Coordinator will work with the athletic director to arrange face-to-face visits with potential club members and steward donors. QualificationsBachelor's degree is required.  Two to three years of fundraising, marketing and/or sales experience, preferably in higher education or athletic fundraising, highly desired.  Some experience with collegiate athletics is desired; a commitment to the Division III philosophy of the student-athlete experience is required. A proficiency with various graphic design platforms will give the candidate an edge.  In addition, the successful candidate must demonstrate excellent interpersonal, collaborative, and teamwork skills, and possess excellent verbal and written communication skills along with a proficiency with current social media platforms. We seek an individual who is goal and achievement oriented; operates with enthusiasm and integrity; and demonstrates traits of good judgment, confidentiality, and discretion in communicating with colleagues and constituents. ApplicationTo apply please complete the Knox College Employment Application by going to the link provided https://knoxhr.bamboohr.com/jobs/. .
