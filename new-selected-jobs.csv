We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is looking for experienced Investigative Reporters who have also demonstrated strong data skills to lead investigative projects.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work.

About the position

At The Markup, investigations are the heart of what we do. We are seeking an inventive, rigorous and collaborative Senior Investigative Reporter who can lead investigations, be comfortable with data and spreadsheets, and write compelling articles based on our findings.

Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data —through crowdsourcing, FOIAs, and automated data collection— to test our theories.

Senior Investigative Reporters will often work alongside a Data Journalist to conduct investigations. Together they will develop a hypothesis and strategize about data collection techniques. The Senior Investigative Reporter will develop the necessary domain expertise in the topic area, find interesting anecdotes to illustrate the findings and conceive and shape the narrative of the article.

This position will report to the Editor-in-Chief.

Responsibilities
----------------

Senior Investigative Reporters will be responsible for working closely with Data Journalists, producing and writing several investigations per quarter, as well as explanatory articles.

Investigative Journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Senior Investigative Reporters will work closely with Investigative Data Journalists to develop hypotheses, collect data and develop findings. You will also work with other parts of the newsroom to explain and promote your findings and with our editorial partners outside the newsroom.

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics that can help us protect our work and our sources.

Skills
------

Because our team- and data-based approach to journalism is new, there won't be many people who have done it before. So don't worry if you haven't done the exact type of data journalism we plan to practice. The skills we are looking for are:

You have strong data judgement and can see a story in a dataset.

You know how to spot a story. You have a minimum of five years of experience as an investigative journalist.

You know proven impact. You have worked on successful investigations that have led to real world change.

You are a fast, clean writer. You have spent a minimum of five years writing news articles on a deadline.

You are passionate about accuracy. You are willing to go the extra mile to check even facts that seem obvious.

You are skilled at cultivating relationships with sources and are diligent about protecting them.

You are data literate. You can use Excel (maybe you are not an expert, but are willing to learn) and committed to learning other technical skills on the job as needed.

You enjoy learning and are flexible. This is a new form of journalism and we'll all be learning how to do it together.

Experience covering the technology industry is a plus, but not a requirement.

Compensation

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We also provide a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

Investigative Data Journalist,The Markup,"New York, NY",2018-11-10 17:37:02,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=32b638197982e277,NaN,indeed,"$95,000 a yearWelcome. We are The Markup (https://themarkup.org/ ( https://themarkup.org/ )) -- a brand new nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization in New York City. We're hiring!

Our mission is to investigate and illuminate the societal effects of new technologies. With little accountability or oversight, technology is affecting who we vote for, how we raise our kids, who is able to get housing, jobs, healthcare and a comfortable life. We will investigate these impacts, with the goal of holding the powerful to account, raising the cost of bad behavior, and spurring reforms. We begin publishing in 2019.

The Markup is seeking Investigative Data Journalists to collect and analyze data showing the impacts of technology on society, have strong news judgement and can see stories in a dataset. This position reports to the Managing Editor.

The Markup is committed to building a team that includes a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-based approach is core for us: we won't tolerate jerks. We aim to be a place where a diverse mix of dedicated people will want to come, to stay, and do their best work. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, country of origin, citizenship, ancestry, physical or mental disability, or veteran status.

------------------
About the position
------------------

Investigations are the heart of what we do. Our approach to investigative journalism is guided by the scientific method. We develop hypotheses and assemble data — through crowdsourcing, FOIA requests, and automated data collection — to test our theories.

Investigative journalism is a team sport. The Markup's Investigative Data Journalists and Investigative Reporters work closely together on stories, and they work with Graphics Editors to help visually explain their findings.

The Markup's investigative data journalists are skilled at working with large and messy datasets, scraping websites, running statistics, finding outside experts and sources, and most importantly knowing what is a story and isn't a story. They are proud of the clean code they write, the statistical tests they run, and can clearly communicate their findings. In short, they produce the facts we rely on for our investigations.

----------------
Responsibilities
----------------

On large investigations you will be responsible for writing methodologies that explain your work, and helping to write the main feature. You care about the quality of your work, so your code is clean, your analysis repeatable, and your prose is clear.

You are crafty. You have a bunch of story ideas, and are on the lookout for more. You know where to gather data, how to collect it, and importantly what to collect.

You are accurate. You won't begin to analyze a dataset until you are certain it is free of errors.

You are an explorer. You visualize the data first before running statistical tests, so you can see where a story might be.

You are collaborative. You work well on teams, and know that holding the powerful to account is what matters.

You know what you don't know. You don't hesitate to pick up the phone to ask questions, find outside statistical help for analysis, can get academics and researchers to review your findings before publication and generally enjoy learning new things.

You value clarity. You know a simple analysis with clear findings is better than a complicated one done with fancy and sophisticated techniques.

You are open and transparent. The Markup shares the data and code behind our investigations, so the Investigative Data Journalist writes code with a reader in mind. And you can write prose precise enough for a technical reader, but approachable for a general audience.

You are experienced. You've worked on data driven stories and know what it takes to develop and execute a data driven story. .

You will also be the custodian of your own digital security. We will provide the tools, but you will need to use two-factor authentication, password managers, encryption and other tools and tactics to protect our work and our sources.

------
Skills
------

You should be comfortable in at least a couple of programming languages, and know which one to use for each task. At The Markup, we use Node.js for scraping, python or ruby for data cleaning and parsing, PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch databases for storage, and R for analysis. We've also used a bit of Rust, so you can use newer or esoteric programming languages if they fit the task. Just know that if you do, you'll be the one responsible for maintaining it. You don't need to know all of these languages and tools, but having knowledge of a few of them is a definite plus.

You should be comfortable on the command line: sometimes a story is just a grep away. The same goes for spreadsheet software like Excel: sometimes you'll find a story in a single cell.

You don't need to be a stats expert, but you should be stats curious. You should be conversant in basic statistics and analysis, and have a commitment to learning on the job.

We're looking for someone who has a strong sense of the limits of his/her own knowledge, so that when you encounter a new problem you ask first: whether that is meeting with an academic, asking questions internally, doing open source research, reading complicated academic papers, filing a FOIA request, or picking up the phone to call a source.

There isn't a template for this job, you might come from a graphics desk, a data desk or have worked outside of journalism. The only thing we ask for is that you have a bachelor's degree and a few years of relevant experience.

We are building an organizational culture that is reader-centered, inventive, rigorous, and courageous. A collaborative team-centered approach is a core value for our team.

------------
Compensation
------------

We pay people fair and reasonable salaries, in accordance with their skills and abilities and experience. We'll also provide a generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, life, disability, pet insurance and retirement plan contributions.

The salary for this position begins at $95,000, and will be established based on the candidate's experience, education and skills.

------------
How to apply
------------

We have engaged DRi Consulting to assist us with this search. To apply, please use the form below to submit a cover letter, resume, 3-5 clips of your previous work, and 3-5 story ideas for investigations you might want to pursue if you joined us. Applications that don't include a cover letter will not be considered. Please do not contact the hiring manager directly. Please do not send a CV or application package to staff at their individual email addresses. If you do, it will probably just get lost.

This position will work out of our New York City office. If you don't currently live in New York but are willing to relocate for this position, please make that clear in your cover letter. We will pay relocation expenses for successful candidates.

At this time, we can't consider applications from people who don't already have the legal right to work in the United States. In order to work for The Markup, you'll be required to provide documentation establishing that you're eligible for U.S. employment."

Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform is delighting customers, and we’re looking for a Senior Data Journalist with a strong sense of ownership to join our Seattle team.
You’ll start from a great foundation. We have a powerful brand, exceptional PR, and lots of great content. Best of all, Textio’s vast language data set allows our platform to discover fascinating narratives, and we love sharing them. All told, the Textio blog got hundreds of thousands of visitors last year. Our readership is executive, global, and growing fast. As more and more leaders realize that augmented writing is going to define enterprise technology over the next decade, there is a voracious appetite for data narratives about the way people are writing and talking.

If you’re a data-minded language person with a penchant for storytelling, there is no better content leadership job in the industry. (We know; we’ve read them all!)
What you'll be doing:
Plan, write, and collaborate on the narratives we tell, including building a rich, detailed, long-form writing discipline.
Own and create content for our Word Nerd blog from end to end, and tackle writing copy across multiple mediums.
Work with language data sets and turn data insights into compelling narratives.
Interview customers, industry leaders, and teammates across disciplines and tell their stories.
Cultivate a community of writers at Textio and among our customers, edit their work, and help them bring out their best work. Last year, more than half our company wrote for our blog.
Partner with our marketing team on brand-building opportunities and challenges. How can we maximize our social media influence? Make our emails land? Spread the word about augmented writing?
We’d love to hear from you if:
You’ve read our blog at https://textio.ai, and you love this kind of writing.
You know how to tell data stories for real people; your work speaks not only to data scientists and linguists, but to anyone.
You understand that the best data narratives are funny, fascinating, or both.
You have a background in linguistics, psychology, data journalism, or another social science, and/or you know how to use math to understand how language works and explain it to people.
You know how to make a story last across channels (social media, webinar, email marketing, etc.) and bring a testing mentality help us improve. You’re eager to prove that you can innovate by trying new tactics.
You are a superb communicator verbally and in writing—Textio stands for editorial quality, and you do too.
You ask smart questions and are an exceptional listener who can find the gem in a customer interview.
You understand that sometimes a great data visualization is worth a thousand words.
You are a disciplined self-starter who has the ability to juggle multiple, demanding initiatives concurrently.
You sweat the small stuff and keep SEO in mind.
You have a point of view but are low ego.
This is a leadership role on our growing brand team. Great writing about language data is a mainstay of what we do at Textio, and you’re just the right person to develop this discipline for us.

Textio embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.
